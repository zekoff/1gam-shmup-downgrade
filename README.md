## Instructions

**Normal mode**: clear stages, kill enemies, hunt UFOs, and collect stars to
achieve a high score. Weapon pickups will increase the power of your weapons.
If you die, your current weapon will reset to its starting power. You will get
an extra life for every 20 stars collected. You may continue after a game over,
but your score will reset to zero. If you choose more difficult stages on the
level select screen, your final score multiplier will increase.

**Challenge mode**: take on exceptionally challenging stages one at a time.

### Mouse control

Mouse control is the preferred way to play. The ship will always move toward the
location of your mouse pointer, and will fire automatically. Hold the left mouse
button to activate alternate fire mode. Click the right button to cycle between
weapons.

### Gamepad control

Gamepad control is experimental and may break at inopportune times.
Move using the D-pad or left thumbstick; the ship will fire automatically.
Hold Button 1 (or the A button on Xbox controllers) to activate alternate fire
mode. Pressing Button 2 (or the X button on Xbox controllers) will cycle between
weapons.
